    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.</li>
        <li>To make the psari plaki, place a large flameproof frying pan or shallow flameproof casserole on a medium-low heat and add the olive oil, onions and garlic. Season well with salt and sauté for 10 minutes so they start to soften.</li>
        <li>Stir in 1½ teaspoons of dried oregano and all the Aleppo pepper, followed by the tinned tomatoes and 100ml/3½fl oz of water. Break the tomatoes up with a spoon and bring everything to the boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes until thickened.</li>
        <li>Stir in most of the flat-leaf parsley, along with all the capers. Add the black olives.</li>
        <li>If your fish is in one piece, cut into four equal portions. Pat the fish dry using kitchen paper and place in a non-reactive bowl or dish. Season it well with salt and pepper and sprinkle with the cumin and remaining ½ teaspoon of oregano.</li>
        <li>Squeeze over the juice of half a lemon and toss it all together.</li>
        <li>Nestle the fish in the tomato sauce and place the pan in the oven and bake for about 20 &ndash; 25 minutes at the same temperature as the potatoes.</li>
        <li>Finish by squeezing the remaining lemon half over the psari plaki and sprinkling over the remaining chopped parsley.</li>    
    </li>
    </ol>
